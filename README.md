Assignment 1 - The Odin Project mini project. The goal is to deconstruct and build a simple web page.

Result - This project was a lot harder than I thought it would be. Despite the Google homepage being a simple web page, there was a lot of css I didn't know how to do from scratch.

I  broke the task into several sections starting with the

1. Top Navigation
2. Logo
3. Search Bar/Form
4. Buttons
5. Footer

Each section had its set of challenges. The biggest issue was understanding the parent/child relationship of CSS. I'm used to modifying CSS rather than coding it myself. I got confused about when it was appropriate to use position:relative vs position: absolute.

I also ran into trouble trying to add the icons into the search bar.

In the end I created a semi-responsive duplicate of the Google page that looks pretty good for a noob like me. :)

Project 1 is done. time to tackle the next one.
